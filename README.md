# micmp

This program compares two or more files to determine whether they are equal or not. The program is made in C and it's ideal for terminal use. The program can do:
  1. Compare two files and retrieve whether they're equal or not.
  2. Compare two files from different shifts.
  3. Compare two files showing in a table the differences between the files (ASCII)

## Syntax

First of all what we need it's to compile micmp.c, type in terminal in the correspondent directory where the file is located.
```
gcc micmp.c -o <desire_name>
```

Once compiled, you can choose executing the different options: (suppose we've created two files : file1.txt and file2.txt, you can download them from this project)

### (1)
```
./<desired_name> file1.txt file2.txt
```

### (2)
```
./<desired_name> -i X:Y file1.txt file2.txt
```
Where X and Y represent a shift (ie, program will start comparing file1 from position X and file2 from Y till the end)

### (3)
```
./<desired_name> -l file1.txt file2.txt
```
![cmp_l](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19231158/25473866/fd8a1c92-2b28-11e7-93b7-c71d3b6d7787.png)

Output when two files are different... (modifying the last line of file1.txt)

"...tools and technologies that allow researchers to study cells and their DNA."  ** modified to ... **
"...tools and technologies that allow researchers to study cells and their -DNA."

```
./<desired_name> -l file1.txt file2.txt
```
![cmp_l2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19231158/25474260/77f953e8-2b2a-11e7-9ac6-5e694acecec5.png)




That's all.
