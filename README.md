# micmp

This program compares two or more files to determine whether they are equal or not. The program is made in C and it's ideal for terminal use. The program can do:
  1. Compare two files and retrieve whether they're equal or not.
  2. Compare two files from different shifts.
  3. Compare two files showing in a table the differences between the files (ASCII)

## Syntax

First of all what we need it's to compile micmp.c, type in terminal in the correspondent directory where the file is located.
```
gcc micmp.c -o <desire_name>
```

Once compiled, you can choose executing the different options: (suppose we've created two files : file1.txt and file2.txt)
(1)
```
./<desire_name> file1.txt file2.txt
```
